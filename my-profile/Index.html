            <p>I am passionate about <strong>Music</strong>. I have spent my whole life playing piano and singing. I always knew I wanted a career in music. In my spare time, I write, produce, and perform my own music. My inspirations include some of the greats: Amy Winehouse, Frank Sinatra, Adele, Frankie Valli, and much more.

            <p>I love to watch <strong>Movies</strong>. Whether it is old timey movies like the "Wizard of Oz" or "Singing in the Rain", to the newest movies on the big screens now! I think movies are a beautiful tool that have the ability to visually transport you wherever you want to go. </p>
